In order to solve the pink screen issue:

Below is a summary of what we have achieved so far and what issues we encountered, followed by a step‐by‐step approach to gradually add back the missing buttons and controls.

Summary of What Works
	•	SceneKit Rendering Fixed:
By forcing the SCNView to use a non‑zero fixed frame (e.g. using UIScreen.main.bounds or a fixed CGRect) and setting its autoresizing mask, we have eliminated the pink screen issue.
	•	The minimal scene test (a simple box) renders correctly.
	•	The debug logs show that the SCNView’s frame is non‑zero and that the scene is attached with the expected number of child nodes.
	•	CubeManager Scene Initialization:
The CubeManager is building the cube and attaching the cubies to the cubeContainer, and the console logs confirm that 8 children are present.

What Did Not Work / Issues Observed
	•	Buttons and Controls Missing:
In our testing with the minimal scene code, the overlay buttons (e.g. “Random”, “Learn”, “Run”) were not visible. This is likely because:
	•	The SCNView is now using a fixed frame that may be overlapping the control buttons.
	•	The layout hierarchy might not be passing along the expected size for the controls.
	•	View Layout and Z-Ordering:
There may be an issue with how the SCNView is embedded within the SwiftUI layout. We need to ensure that the SCNView does not cover up the buttons or that the buttons are layered on top.
	•	Debugging Information:
We added debug logging for frame sizes, scene node counts, etc. This helped diagnose the pink screen, but now that part works fine.

Gradually Adding Back the Buttons and Controls

We can use a ZStack (or a VStack with defined portions) to layer the SCNView behind the control panel. Here’s a gradual plan:
	1.	Wrap the SCNView in a ZStack:
The ZStack will contain the 3D cube view in the background and a control panel (buttons) overlaid on top.
	2.	Ensure the Control Panel Has a Nonzero Frame:
We can use a VStack with a fixed height (or a GeometryReader to partition the screen) so that the buttons always appear.
	3.	Test the Layout:
Verify with debug prints that both the SCNView and the control panel are visible.

Below is an updated version of the SimulationView that uses a ZStack to layer the SCNView behind the control buttons:

import SwiftUI

struct SimulationView: View {
    let settings: CubeSettings
    @StateObject private var cubeManager: CubeManager
    @StateObject private var rlAgent: RLAgentSimple

    init(settings: CubeSettings) {
        self.settings = settings
        let manager = CubeManager(settings: settings)
        _cubeManager = StateObject(wrappedValue: manager)
        
        var config = RLConfig()
        config.size = settings.size
        _rlAgent = StateObject(wrappedValue: RLAgentSimple(config: config))
    }
    
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            // 3D Cube view in the background.
            RubiksCubeFullView(cubeManager: cubeManager)
                .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
            // Overlay control panel.
            VStack {
                Spacer()
                VStack(spacing: 20) {
                    Text("Episode: \(rlAgent.currentEpisode) / \(rlAgent.totalEpisodes)")
                        .foregroundColor(.white)
                    Text("Max Reward: \(String(format: "%.2f", rlAgent.maxReward))")
                        .foregroundColor(.white)
                    HStack(spacing: 30) {
                        Button(action: {
                            cubeManager.randomizeCube()
                        }) {
                            Text("Random")
                                .padding()
                                .background(Color.purple)
                                .foregroundColor(.white)
                                .cornerRadius(12)
                        }
                        Button(action: {
                            rlAgent.startTraining(environment: cubeManager) {
                                print("Training converged or stopped.")
                            }
                        }) {
                            Text("Learn")
                                .padding()
                                .background(rlAgent.isTraining ? Color.gray : Color.blue)
                                .foregroundColor(.white)
                                .cornerRadius(12)
                        }
                        .disabled(rlAgent.isTraining)
                        Button(action: {
                            let currentState = cubeManager.getBlueCornerState()
                            print("Current blue corner state: \(currentState)")
                            let solution = rlAgent.getSolution(from: currentState, maxDepth: rlAgent.config.maxSteps)
                            print("RL solution: \(solution.map { $0.description })")
                            cubeManager.animateSolution(moves: solution)
                        }) {
                            Text("Run")
                                .padding()
                                .background(Color.green)
                                .foregroundColor(.white)
                                .cornerRadius(12)
                        }
                    }
                }
                .padding()
                .background(Color.black.opacity(0.6))
            }
        }
        .onAppear {
            print("SimulationView onAppear: Layout updated.")
        }
        .preferredColorScheme(.dark)
    }
}

Explanation
	•	ZStack Layout:
The entire screen is a ZStack. The RubiksCubeFullView (the SCNView) is placed at the back and set to ignore safe areas.
A VStack is overlaid at the bottom (using Spacer() above) to show the control panel.
	•	Control Panel Appearance:
The control panel has a semi-transparent black background to help it stand out from the cube.
	•	Edges & Frames:
We ensure that the SCNView uses .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all) so that it fills the entire background.

Next Steps
	1.	Replace your current SimulationView with the code above.
	2.	Run the app and check that:
	•	The 3D cube is visible.
	•	The control panel with buttons appears at the bottom.
	•	The console logs show nonzero frames and the correct number of child nodes.
	3.	If everything appears as expected, you can further refine the layout (for example, add padding or adjust the control panel size).

Let me know if this layout now shows the cube and the control buttons correctly.

Great to hear that the simulation view and controls are now working!

Summary of What We Did:
	1.	SceneKit Rendering Issue (Pink Screen):
	•	We ensured that the SCNView was created with a nonzero fixed frame (using a fixed CGRect or UIScreen.main.bounds) and set its autoresizingMask so that it resizes properly.
	•	We wrapped the SCNView in a ZStack and used a GeometryReader (or fixed frames in the SimulationView) so that the view gets laid out correctly.
	•	We added debug logs in makeUIView and updateUIView to verify that the scene and node hierarchy were correctly attached.
	2.	Layout & Z-Ordering:
	•	We used a ZStack to layer the 3D cube in the background and a semi-transparent control panel (with “Random”, “Learn”, “Run” buttons) overlaid at the bottom.
	3.	Threading and Debugging:
	•	We ensured that SceneKit updates and node modifications are done on the main thread.
	•	We provided logging (frame sizes, node counts, etc.) to help diagnose any issues.
	4.	Customizable Cube Settings:
	•	We created a settings page (using SwiftUI’s Form) so that the user can choose cube dimensions (X, Y, Z), initial blue position, and goal position.
	•	The settings are passed to the CubeManager and RLAgent so that the simulation and RL training use the customized cube.
	5.	RL Framework Customization:
	•	The RL state is defined as the linear index of the blue cubie.
	•	The action set includes all possible slice rotations (with both clockwise and anticlockwise moves).
	•	The reward is –1 per step, with a bonus of (100 – steps) if the blue cubie reaches the target.
	•	The maximum steps and target reward are computed from the cube size.
	•	The training loop prints Q‑table statistics every 1,000 episodes and stops when convergence is reached.

Since everything now works as intended, you can further tune the hyperparameters or expand the functionality as needed.
